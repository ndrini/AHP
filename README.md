# 1. Synopsis
AHP allow the analytic hierarchy process by a python script.

## 1.1 Code Example
A mathematical, and coherent, translation of human choices is provided.

## 1.2 Motivation
Supply to everyone a clear description of the process (with also the motivation), an a visual image of the result. 

## Installation
Check the presence of Pipfile into the main directory. And run: 

	$ pipenv shell 

then 
	
	$ pipenv install 


Then, only execute the ahp.py file in the same directory you download the main file:


	python ahp.py

The folders called choices_all and choices should stay in the same directory too. 


## Use
To run the AHP process, each case must be saved as a text file in the "choices" directory.
You can use an already prepared file as pattern.

To use the prepared pattern, you need to supply the list of choices and of the criteria involved in the process, and to call the file the_name_you_want_CC.txt.

	So, for instance, the file mobile_CC.txt, should contain: 

	[:opz:]
	opz_1  # comment
	opz_2  # comment
	opz_3  # comment
	[/:opz:]

	[:crit:]
	crit_1  # comment
	crit_2  # comment
	crit_3  # comment
	crit_4  # comment
	[/:crit:] 

To a correct visualization, please, avoid unicode character in variables (they don't matter in comment).

About the numerical evaluations. 
	You can translate as "A is really really more important than B" as:
						B		
	A 			-->     8	-->  because of ...

	The scale may be:
	2	"A is a little bit 		more 		important than B"
	3	"A is 			 		more 		important than B"
	6	"A is really	 		more 		important than B"
	9	"A is extremely	 		more 		important than B"
	1/2	"A is a little bit		less 		important than B"
	1/3	"A is 			 		less 		important than B"
	1/6	"A is really	 		less 		important than B"
	1/9	"A is extremely	 		less 		important than B"



Example:

	[:g_c:]
						B_criteria        
	A_criteria		--> 		3		--> 	     
						C_criteria         
	A_criteria 		--> 		5		--> 	 

	In this situation, with respect to the A_criteria, C_criteria is less important than B_criteria.



## API Reference


## Tests
The script is provided with a test file (called “ahp_test.py”) for testing. 

## Contributors
Permit the storage in a separate file of the choices.
Let's write the choices file in a xml style
(not a different way parsed style).
